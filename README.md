# Robotic-Arm-Pick-Place
Project Submission #2 

Hello,

Firt off, sorry to submit with some missing points.
The end of the code still not 100% clear to me but I hope to get some positive feedback with it.

By the way, chapter #1 still opened missing a lot from my side but I decide to review it once I have finished the entire program, of course, if it is a problem for you.


Kindest regards,
Daniel Araujo
